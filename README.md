# Atlantic Surveys Species Lists Workshop 2022

Repository to facilitate the species list workshop.

## Objectives

- Validate a North Atlantic marine species name total checklist for [Andes](https://github.com/dfo-gulf-science/andes/)
- Enable regional survey-specific lists in Andes
- Improving the effective display of names and codes in Andes

## Presentations



## Topics for discussion

- first starting point: use the World Register of Marine Species

- second starting point: our "species lists" do not all include a column called "taxonomic rank", i.e. they are one-dimensional lists


- How does Andes deal with a species list?

- Dealing with "in-house" codes and how they can (or perhaps should not) be used in Andes

- Summary of issues encountered recently ([link to cruises on dmapps](http://dmapps/en/cruises/))
	- [2022 winter survey in the Gulf](http://dmapps/en/cruises/37/view/) (joint Quebec and Gulf project)
	- Maritimes surveys, [Georges 2022](http://dmapps/en/cruises/38/view/), [Summer 2022 Teleost](http://dmapps/en/cruises/43/view/), [Summer 2022 Cabot](http://dmapps/en/cruises/42/view/) (discuss Mike's ["tweaks"](https://github.com/PopulationEcologyDivision/andesmerge/blob/main/R/tweaks.R))
	- Gulf September survey[Cartier 2022](http://dmapps/en/cruises/48/view/), [Teleost 2022](http://dmapps/en/cruises/49/view/) (Pablo's and François-Étienne's experience)

- How to avoid these issues in the future?

- What species codes are / have been used in the survey databases? 

- Policy to identify specimens at the most precise taxonomic level possible (within the practical realities of sampling at sea)

- In what years were species consistently identified? How to deal with these data when generating indices or producing distribution maps?

- Identification guides used during surveys. Example of the recent sponges guide for the Gulf. These guides must be consistent with the species list used.

- Common name(s) to use, what if there are a number of options? how to deal with multiple languages?

- demo of worms R package to extract taxonomic hierarchy from WORMS


## Expected outcomes

- Andes species list that satisfies all users 

- Resolution of all in-house codes to a valid AphiaID

- Publish checklists
	- GitHub (e.g., https://github.com/claudenozeres/Taxon-IML )
	- Atlantic (main)
	- Regions (branches)
	

- ChecklistBank (https://www.checklistbank.org/ )

- DFO National databases

- Publish report or article (e.g., Checklist as a Data Paper: https://bdj.pensoft.net/)

- Give a summary presentation for each region

- Provide a Best Practices summary for survey users of ANDES
