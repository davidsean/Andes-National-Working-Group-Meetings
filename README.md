# (Unofficial) Andes Community Group Meeting 2024

This repository aims to facilitate the planning and coordination of a second Andes Workshop Meeting, similar to what we did back in 2022 to deal with species issues ([see this branch](https://github.com/dfo-gulf-science/Andes-National-Working-Group-Meetings/tree/2022)). This time, the proposed workshop aims to resolve recurring issues encountered when integrating Andes data into existing data repositories. This workshop also coincides with the publication of a Technical Report on Andes and the release of Andes Version 3. This would also be a good forum to discuss Andes governance.

The last workshop was held in Moncton, NB and most participants were present in-person. Ideally we would also hold this second workshop in-person.

## Objectives

- Establish a tenable and coherent strategy for reporting in Andes, ensuring stability for all end users
- Decide on a single format for an official Andes Ecosystem Survey Report
- Understand regional post-processing workflows for Ecosystem Survey data
- Understand regional post-processing workflows for Oceanographic data
  - DART?
  - BioChem?
  - IML Workflow?
      
- Discuss Andes governance (for example, is there a need for an Andes National Steering Committee? other options?) 
- Discuss upcoming changes to Port Sampling module

## Prerequisites

- Willingness to improve regional systems and to participate in the development of Andes.

## Topics for discussion

- What is _the_ optimal format for the Official Andes Ecosystem Survey Reports (JSON vs. SQLite3 vs. NetCDF)
- Should multiple CSV reports be supported? Is there an alternative to one report type per client/usage case?
- What is the best way to document report metadata?
- R package for manipulating Andes official report

## Expected outcomes

- A clear definition of a "once and for all" Andes report for data from the Ecosystem Survey module
- A solid plan for developing a toolkit for dealing with Andes ES reports
