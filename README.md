## Presentations



## Topics for discussion

first starting point: use the World Register of Marine Species

second starting point: our "species lists" do not all include a column called "taxonomic rank", i.e. they are one-dimensional lists

How does Andes deal with a species list?

Dealing with "in-house" codes and how they can (or perhaps should not) be used in Andes


Summary of issues encountered recently

Winter survey

Maritimes surveys (discuss Mike's "tweaks")

Gulf September survey (Pablo's and François-Étienne's experience)

How to avoid these issues in the future?

Identification guides must be consistent with the species list used


Planned outcomes of the workshop:

- Andes species list that satisfies all users 
- resolution of all in-house codes to a valid AphiaID


Common name(s) to use, what if there are a number of options? how to deal with multiple languages?
